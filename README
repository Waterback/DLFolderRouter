DownloadFolder is a short little experiment with Camel to empty my Downloads Folder and send 
the files in predefined directions.
Directions can be defined in a properties file.
Because it is an experiment i also wanted to work/learn a new IDE/Server: Netbeans and Glassfish.
So don't wonder about the Project being a webproject.
